                    <h3>Introduction</h3>
                    <p>Modern India has had a strong focus on science and technology, realising that it is a key element
                        for economic growth. India ranks third among the most attractive investment destinations for
                        technology transactions in the world. With more and more multinational companies setting up
                        their R&D centres in India, the sector has seen an uptrend in investment in recent years.</p>
                    <p>India is among the top countries globally in the field of scientific research, positioned as one
                        of the top five nations in the field of space exploration. The country has regularly undertaken
                        space missions, including missions to the moon and the famed Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle
                        (PSLV). India is likely to take a leading role in launching satellites for the SAARC nations,
                        generating revenue by offering its space facilities for use to other countries</p>
                    <p>The government has introduced multiple policies aimed at projecting India as a science and
                        technology powerhouse and promoting both public and private sector involvement in the R&D
                        practice. As a result, India's gross expenditure on R&D (GERD) has been consistently increasing
                        over the years. The government has also implemented several fellowship schemes to nurture the
                        human capacity for advanced research in the country.</p>
